1. **Remove Punctuation:**
   - Punctuation marks (such as periods, commas, question marks, etc.) don't usually carry much meaningful information in text analysis tasks like sentiment analysis or document classification. Removing them helps simplify the text and focus on the actual content.

2. **Lowercase Conversion:**
   - Converting all text to lowercase is a common preprocessing step. This helps standardize the text and ensures that words are treated the same regardless of their capitalization. For example, "Hello" and "hello" should be considered the same word in most text analysis tasks.

3. **Tokenization:**
   - Tokenization is the process of splitting text into individual words or tokens. This is a crucial step for many text processing tasks, as it allows further processing to be performed on each word separately.

4. **Remove Stopwords:**
   - Stopwords are common words in a language (e.g., "the", "and", "is") that occur frequently but don't carry significant meaning on their own. Removing stopwords can help reduce noise in the data and focus on the more meaningful words. However, the importance of this step depends on the specific analysis task. In some cases, you might want to retain stopwords if they are relevant to the context.

5. **Stemming:**
   - Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root or base form by removing suffixes. For example, "running" and "ran" both stem to "run". Stemming helps to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and group together words with similar meanings. However, stemming can sometimes produce non-words, which might affect the interpretability of the results.

6. **Lemmatization:**
   - Lemmatization is similar to stemming but produces valid words (known as lemmas) by considering the context and morphological analysis of the words. For example, "running" would be lemmatized to "run", and "better" would be lemmatized to "good". Lemmatization preserves the semantic meaning of words better than stemming and is often preferred in tasks where word sense disambiguation is important.

### Basic Text Preprocessing Script

This Python script takes a CSV file from the desktop, performs text preprocessing, and saves the processed data as a new CSV file on the desktop.

**Run the Script:**
   - Run the script `text_processing.py`.
