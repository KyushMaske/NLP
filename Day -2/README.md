# Feature Extraction

Today, my primary focus is on Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, Bag-of-Words (BoW), and TF-IDF to convert raw text data into numerical representations that can be processed by models

**Label Encoding**
    - converts categorical labels into integer values, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms that can interpret ordinal relationships

**One-Hot Encoding**
    -converts categorical labels into a binary matrix, which is useful for algorithms that cannot interpret ordinal relationships and need a non-ordinal representation of the data.

**Bag-of-Words (BoW)**
    - converts text documents into a matrix of token counts. Each column in the matrix represents a word from the vocabulary, while each row represents a document from the corpus.

**TF-IDF**
    - converts text documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features. It reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire corpus.
